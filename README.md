# CodeAlpha_Emotion-Recognition
Built an Emotion Recognition from Speech system during my ML Internship at CodeAlpha to detect emotional states like Happy, Sad, Fearful, and Disgust using voice input. This AI-powered solution promotes emotional awareness in digital spaces via a Tkinter-based real-time GUI.
